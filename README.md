This paper employs emerging smartphone-based location data and produces daily human mobility measurements using Nigeria as an application site. A data-driven analytical framework is developed for rigorously producing such measures using proven location intelligence and data mining algorithms. The study demonstrates the framework at the beginning time period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and successfully quantifies human mobility patterns and trends in response to the unprecedented public health event. Another highlight of the paper is the assessment of the effectiveness in mobility restricting policies as key lessons learned from the pandemic. We found that travel bans and federal lockdown policies failed to restrict trip-making behavior but had a significant impact on distance traveled. The paper has contributed a first attempt to quantify daily human mobility and how mobility-restricting policies took effect in sub-Sahara Africa. This has the potential to enable a wide spectrum of quantitative studies on human mobility and health in sub-Sahara Africa using well controlled publicly available large data sets.
